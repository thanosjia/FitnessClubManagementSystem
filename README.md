Unfortunately I wasn't able to design an ER model/schema or record a video demonstration in time.

Here are instructions on how to run FitnessClubDBMS:

1. Create a Database 'FitnessClub' in pgAdmin4.
2. Install the psycopg2 library using pip in a terminal: 'pip install psycopg2-binary'
3. Open a terminal in the src folder
4. Initialize and populate the database by entering 'python database_init.py' into the terimnal
5. Run the Fitness Club Database Management System by entering 'FitnessClubDBMS.py' into the terminal
